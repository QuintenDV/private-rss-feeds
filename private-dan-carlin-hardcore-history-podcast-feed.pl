private-dan-carlin-hardcore-history-podcast-feed.pl - Create a private Hardcore History podcast feed

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    # Create a directory structure for it, e.g.:
    mkdir -p ~/www/private-noindex/dchha
    cd ~/www/private-noindex/dchha
    ln -s /path/to/directory/with/mp3s dchha-mp3

    # Generate a podcast.atom:
    perl ~/g/private-dan-carlin-hardcore-history-podcast-feed/private-dan-carlin-hardcore-history-podcast-feed.pl \
        --url-prefix=http://example.com/private-noindex/dchha \
        --mp3-subdir=dchha-mp3 >podcast.atom

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Dan Carlin's Hardcore History podcast only has the last X episodes,
but you can buy the old episodes.

Unfortunately there's no way to subscribe to a paid-for feed with all
the episodes, but if you've bought the old episodes this allows you to
generate that for yourself and host it on your own server.

You probably need to pipe the feed to a file called F<podcast.atom> in
the C<--url-prefix> directory, because we refer to that as an absolute
link in the feed itself.

    <description>Was Alexander the Great as bad a person as Hitler? What was the greatest army of all time? Which U.S. President was the worst? Hardcore History discusses the issues and questions history fans love.</description>
    <itunes:summary>In "Hardcore History" the very unconventional Dan Carlin takes his "Martian", outside-the-box way of thinking and applies it to the past. Was Alexander the Great as bad a person as Adolf Hitler? What would Apaches with modern weapons be like? Will our modern civilization ever fall like civilizations from past eras? This is a difficult-to-classify show that has a rather sharp edge. It's not for everyone. But the innovative style and approach has made "Dan Carlin's Hardcore History" a New Media hit. </itunes:summary>
