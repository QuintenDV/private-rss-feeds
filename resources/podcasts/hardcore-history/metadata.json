    "summary": "In \"Hardcore History\" the very unconventional Dan Carlin takes his \"Martian\", outside-the-box way of thinking and applies it to the past. Was Alexander the Great as bad a person as Adolf Hitler? What would Apaches with modern weapons be like? Will our modern civilization ever fall like civilizations from past eras? This is a difficult-to-classify show that has a rather sharp edge. It's not for everyone. But the innovative style and approach has made \"Dan Carlin's Hardcore History\" a New Media hit. ",
